# AutoML

Automated machine learning is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. It automates things like data cleaning/imputation/validation, feature engineering, training models, model selection and hyper-parameter choices.

`Pycaret` is a library in python that can facilitate this. This link shows which functions to use in order to fit a model. https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/functions#compare_models
